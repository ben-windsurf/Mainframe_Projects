# Mainframe Projects

Welcome to my **Mainframe Projects** repository! üöÄ This is where I showcase my skills and projects related to Mainframe technologies, including COBOL, JCL, and SQL. These scripts highlight my ability to work with legacy systems while building a strong foundation for enterprise applications.

## üìÇ Project Structure
This repository is organized into the following folders:
- **COBOL:** Programs demonstrating COBOL basics, file handling, and more.
- **JCL:** Scripts to execute and manage batch jobs.
- **SQL:** Queries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **User Data:** Sample data files for testing and demonstration purposes.

## üìú Projects Overview

### COBOL
1. **Hello World Program** (`hello_world.cobol`):
   - A basic COBOL program that demonstrates fundamental syntax and file output operations. Perfect for beginners learning COBOL structure.

2. **Payroll Calculator** (`PAYROLL-CALC.cobol`):
   - Calculates monthly pay from annual salaries by reading employee data and generating payroll output. Demonstrates file processing and arithmetic operations.

3. **File Processing with Sorting** (`sort_employees.cobol`):
   - A COBOL program that sorts employee data by salary and writes the sorted output to a new file. It demonstrates file handling and sorting techniques.

4. **Report Generator** (`employee_report.cobol`):
   - Generates a summary report of employees with salaries exceeding a specified threshold. It showcases conditional logic and report generation.

### JCL
1. **COBOL Program Execution** (`run_cobol.jcl`):
   - General-purpose JCL script for executing COBOL programs with proper dataset allocation and job control statements.

2. **Conditional Execution** (`conditional_execution.jcl`):
   - Executes a COBOL program and conditionally runs a secondary step based on the success of the first step.

3. **VSAM File Management** (`vsam_file_management.jcl`):
   - Defines and loads a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) using IDCAMS, demonstrating dataset management.

### SQL
1. **Simple Employee Query** (`simple_query.sql`):
   - Basic SQL query to retrieve active IT employees, demonstrating fundamental SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY operations.

2. **Employee Data Insights** (`employee_data_insights.sql`):
   - Retrieves employees with salaries above their department average. Demonstrates subqueries and aggregation.

3. **Monthly Sales Report** (`monthly_sales_report.sql`):
   - Calculates total sales for each product category for the current month. Demonstrates grouping and aggregation.

4. **Sales Analysis by Country** (`sales_by_country.sql`):
   - Complex analytical query that performs comprehensive sales analysis grouped by country, including multiple joins, temporary tables, and advanced aggregations.

## üìä Data Files
- **Employee Data** (`EMPLOYEES.IN`):
  - Sample employee input file containing employee IDs, names, and salary information used by COBOL programs for testing and demonstration.

- **Customer Data** (`User Data/customer_data.csv`):
  - CSV file containing customer information including contact details, addresses, and order numbers for SQL analysis projects.

- **Sales Data** (`User Data/sales_data.csv`):
  - CSV file with sales transaction data including product information, quantities, prices, and order details for comprehensive sales analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files
- **Git Attributes** (`.gitattributes`):
  - Git configuration file for handling line endings and text file normalization across different operating systems.
